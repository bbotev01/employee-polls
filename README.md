# Employee Polls Project
This is the final project for Udacity's React nanodegree program

# Goal
Build an application that employees of a company can use create a poll with two proposed solutions. Employees can then vote on these solutions and see which solutions have the most votes. In addition, have a dashboard that lists every employee ordered by the number of polls they've created and answered. To give employees incentive to use your application, HR will give a prize each quarter for the top employees who have created and answered the most polls.

# How to run

- start the development server with `npm start`

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
