# Employee Polls Project

This is the final project for Udacity's React nanodegree program. 

# Goal 

The goal is to build a React application using Redux that employees of a company can use to create a poll with two proposed solutions. Employees can then vote on these solutions and see which solutions have the most votes. In addition, have a dashboard that lists every employee ordered by the number of polls they've created and answered.
